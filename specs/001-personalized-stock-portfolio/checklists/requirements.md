# Specification Quality Checklist: Personalized Stock Portfolio App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ No mention of specific technologies (frameworks, databases, programming languages)
- ✅ All sections use business/user-focused language
- ✅ User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are complete

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All 18 functional requirements are specific and testable
- ✅ 9 success criteria defined with measurable metrics (time, percentage, user satisfaction)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "1초 이내 결과 표시" instead of "API latency < 1s")
- ✅ 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (total 15 acceptance tests)
- ✅ Edge cases identified with reasonable default behaviors
- ✅ Scope is bounded (watchlist: 50 items max, portfolio: 100 items max)
- ✅ Dependencies clear: external stock API, 5-minute caching strategy

### Feature Readiness ✅
- ✅ All functional requirements map to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Primary user flows covered: authentication → watchlist → stock details → portfolio management
- ✅ Measurable outcomes align with user stories (3초 watchlist load, 1초 quote display, 2분 portfolio creation)
- ✅ No technology leaks detected

## Notes

**Specification is ready for planning phase** (`/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`).

All validation criteria passed without requiring updates. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic
- Measurable and testable
- Focused on user value

No follow-up actions required.
